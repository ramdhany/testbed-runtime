  Testbed Runtime Federator Assembly

What does this directory contain?

  This directory contains the three federator implementations of the WISEBED APIs, namely iWSN, RS
  and SNAA. It further contains configuration files and startup scripts for Linux (32 and 64 bit)
  as well as for Mac OS X (Universal, 64 bit). The startup scripts work like the well-known init
  scripts of Linux.

  $TR_ASSEMBLY_HOME/bin/   - startup scripts
  $TR_ASSEMBLY_HOME/conf/  - configuration files
  $TR_ASSEMBLY_HOME/lib/   - native libraries and java jars of iWSN, RS and SNAA
  $TR_ASSEMBLY_HOME/logs/  - logging output

  The programs can be started and stopped by running the appropriate script and passing the
  argument 'start' or 'stop'. Passing the argument 'install' will install the program startup
  script as daemon to the default runlevel, running 'remove' will remove the daemon.

  The program are always started in non-interactive daemon mode, logging to the logs/ directory.
