  Testbed Runtime Sensor Network Authentication and Authorization (SNAA) implementation

What does this directory contain?

  This directory contains the implementation of the WISEBED Sensor Network Authentication and
  Authorization (SNAA) API.
  It further contains configuration files and startup scripts for Linux (32 and 64 bit) as well as
  for Mac OS X (Universal, 64 bit). The startup scripts work like the well-known init scripts
  of Linux.

  $SNAA_ASSEMBLY_HOME/bin/   - startup scripts
  $SNAA_ASSEMBLY_HOME/conf/  - configuration files
  $SNAA_ASSEMBLY_HOME/lib/   - native libraries and java jars
  $SNAA_ASSEMBLY_HOME/logs/  - logging output

  The programs can be started and stopped by running the appropriate script and passing the
  argument 'start' or 'stop'. Passing the argument 'install' will install the program startup
  script as daemon to the default runlevel, running 'remove' will remove the daemon.

  The program are always started in non-interactive daemon mode, logging to the logs/ directory.
