This directory contains libraries and dependencies of the JAX-WS RI ("Metro")
Web Service stack in version 2.2.1. As only 2.1.x is part of the JRE / JDK 6
in the current version we need to use the endorsed libraries mechanism to use
a newer version. Using this newer version got necessary because of a bug in
the JDK version that could not use the http.keepAlive property correctly when
delivering messages to the client (see [1]). The java endorsed library
mechanism must be used and pointed to this directy in order for Testbed
Runtime to work properly.
